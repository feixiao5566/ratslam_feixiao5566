okay, i found something interesting about the program of ratslam, now let me told you :
when davidmball write he`s first vision of the code , he want to use serialisation to save his data.
but there has some error then he abandon to save his data, he leave a comment "unsupported for the moment until fix for serialisation" .then he never update this program
someone want to use them, so they modified DB`s program. they delete his comment but leave the useless defination about serialisation.
when i found the modified program, I`m confuse why they include a serialisation head and dont have a data file.
then i looked DB`s comment, they must be forget to fix the todo list :^>
luckly, i fix the serialist save the data. (before that, i even think it could not to use serialist!)
don`t make circulate erroneous, and believe youself:^)
# ratslam_feixiao5566
